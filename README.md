# Country Data Dashboard

This project is a full-stack web application that displays country information using the REST Countries API. It consists of a frontend built with React/Next.js and a backend built with Node.js/Express.

## Project Structure

- `frontend/`: Contains the code for the frontend (React/Next.js).
- `backend/`: Contains the code for the backend (Node.js/Express).
  
## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14.x or higher)
- npm or yarn or pnpm

## Running the Project in Development Mode

To run the project in development mode, you need to start both the backend and frontend servers.

### Starting the Backend

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the backend directory:

```
cd country-data-backend
```

2. Install the dependencies:

npm

```
npm install
```

pnpm

```

yarn:

```
yarn install
```

3. Start the development server:

npm

```
npm run dev
```

pnpm
```
pnpm run dev
```
